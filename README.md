## Acoustic Localization and Communication Using a MEMS Microphone for Low-cost and Low-power Bio-inspired Underwater Robots

This repository provides the code used to perform acoustic pseudoranging, as well as a few notes on hardware preparation and observations for future iterations. 

### Dependencies

The system runs on a raspberry pi using Python3. The following non-default packages are required:
* numpy
* librosa
* soundcard
* soundfile
* pyaudio
